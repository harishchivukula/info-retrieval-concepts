Sitting on the terrace and observing the night sky in all its infinite glory was, and always will be, one
of the reasons I consider myself lucky to be alive. There is just something so humbling looking up to
the heavens and wondering about one's place in the universe. I grew up in a twin bungalow with a
garden and was never alone in me going up to the terrace to meet the moon. I was always in the
presence of the tree that grew up with me.
Up on the terrace, I found solitude. The one place in the house, nay, the world that let me be.
Peaceful and quiet. All but the airplanes that subtly reminded me of the place and time I live in this
world. Everything around my house switched off two hours before midnight. People shut down their
shops and retreated to the comfort of their homes. And I waited right there to witness the drop in
decibel, signifying the end of the day. The night grew stronger as it got quieter, and suddenly I was
the only one that existed within my visible universe. Me, the airplanes, and the occasional dog on
the street. My company, the tree surrounded by all its friends from the garden. considering
